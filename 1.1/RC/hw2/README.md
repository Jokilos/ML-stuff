# *WARING: the 'ball_is_close' assert in commented out*

To print out the data about car and ball position every step, set 
DEBUG variable in the begging of the solution to 'True'.

Set SLEEP to 'True' to sleep for 100 seconds at the end of each task.

I used find_color script for finding the colors of objects in task 2 and
draw_objectpoints for finding correct objpoint placement for task 3.
