    "### 1 Cyclic multiplication. - 3p\n",
    "You probably know that numpy will broadcast multiplication if one of the dimensions is of size 1, but what if it could if one of the dimensions was a divisor of the other? Show to Bajtazar that you can do it for 1-D arrays. `cyclic_multiply` gets two 1-D arrays - `big` and `small`, where the `len(big) % len(small) == 0`. Your answer should be the pointwise multiplication of those two vectors, as if the `small` vector was repeated enough times to match it's size to the `big` vector. E.g if `big = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `small = [1, 2]`, then you should return `[1*1, 2*2, 3*1, 4*2] = [1, 4, 3, 8]`"
