I developed the code in the jupyter notebook - `stitch.ipynb`, so i included it in the solution.

Then i converted the notebook to `stitch.py` script and cleaned it up.

I added 7 functions, each one corresponding to one task. For example running `task1_snippet` will
generate files labeled `task1_solution...` in `task_solutions` folder.

There are also non-generatable solutions, which are screenshots of the code.

They are at the end of the file, and only one is uncommented so the output is
not as messy.

In order to run the solution, you should create venv, clone the superglue repo and make sure that
venv directory matches in the script.

I am posting my solution with solution files already included, so they can be inspected without
running the code.
